"""
The half of the keypad that does not touch GPIO: pins, layout, line editing.

Kept separate from ``keypad`` because that module imports ``RPi.GPIO`` at the
top, which does not exist on a development laptop. Everything here can be
imported, tested and exercised anywhere — which is what lets the mock keypad
put a typed line through exactly the key-by-key path the real one uses.

Wiring
------
Eight pins: four rows driven as outputs, four columns read as inputs with the
internal pull-ups on. Idle, every row is held LOW, so a column reads LOW only
while a key bridges it to a row. To find *which* key, one row at a time is
pulled LOW with the other three HIGH.

Which of the eight connector pins are rows and which are columns is a choice,
not a fact: get it backwards and the matrix still scans, it just comes out
transposed. The default matches the labels on the connector — A/B/C/D as rows,
1/2/3/4 as columns.

Layout
------
A key is identified by its position in the matrix, never by what is printed on
the cap, because the print varies between keypads that are wired identically.
The default below is the common 4x4 membrane arrangement. A calculator-style
pad often puts 7/8/9 on the top row instead, so treat the default as a starting
point and confirm it: ``python src/keypad.py --test`` prints the position and
token of each key as you press it, and BOILERROOM_KEYPAD_LAYOUT overrides the
table without touching this file.

Tokens
------
Each position emits either a single character, which is appended to whatever is
being typed, or one of three control tokens:

  ``enter``   accept the line — and, on the display, select the highlighted row
  ``del``     rub out the last character
  ``cancel``  go back: every menu reads an empty answer as "back"

Ten digits leaves six keys for the six functions the menus actually need:
accept, rub out, cancel, ``.`` for a decimal temperature, ``,`` to separate a
list of units, and ``-`` which is what clears a limit.

The default below matches the pad fitted to this device, whose caps read::

    1 2 3 A
    4 5 6 B
    7 8 9 C
    * 0 # D

so ``#`` accepts and ``*`` goes back — the two the operator reaches for most,
on the two keys that are not digits and not tucked up the right-hand side. That
leaves A-D for the four remaining functions. On the graphical display, ``2``
and ``8`` also scroll: they sit above and below ``5`` and read as up and down
without anything printed on them saying so.

Caps
----
What is printed on a key and what it emits are different things, and the legend
strip on the display has to name the printed one — telling an operator to press
"cancel" is no use when the cap says ``*``. ``KEY_CAPS`` is that second table,
overridable with BOILERROOM_KEYPAD_CAPS in the same format as the layout.
