"""
Interactive control menu — runs concurrently with the sensor loop.

Blocking terminal input runs in a worker thread via asyncio.to_thread so the
event loop keeps polling sensors and posting telemetry.

Answers come from an input device rather than from ``input()`` directly: the
keyboard on the bench, the GPIO matrix keypad on the installed hardware, chosen
by USE_MOCK_HARDWARE the same way the relays and sensor readers are. Both hand
back a whole line, so there is one menu rather than a keyboard menu and a
keypad menu drifting apart.

Every prompt therefore has to be answerable from sixteen keys. The menus were
already numeric; what needed work was the free text around them, and the
parsers now take a digit form of each — days as 1-7, a time as HHMM, a date as
YYYYMMDD — alongside the words. See ``keypad_layout`` for the key table.

The graphical display
---------------------
Where one is fitted, the same menu is shown on it instead: one highlighted row
at a time, moved with ``2`` and ``8``, opened with ``#`` and left with ``*``,
with a legend along the bottom saying so. The functions below did not have to
change for it. Two things carry them across:

  * the option tables are the menu, and both faces are built from them — the
    numbered text for a terminal, the selectable list for the panel, so the two
    cannot drift apart
  * everything written with ``state.echo`` is captured rather than printed, and
    shown a screenful at a time the moment something asks for input

Which means a screen with six rows and a screen with fifty show the same
things, and there is one implementation of what those things are.
