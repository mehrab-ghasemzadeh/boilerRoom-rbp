"""
Temperature limit enforcement.

``config.apply`` carries operating limits. This module enforces them: a boiler
is cut when its water temperature reaches ``max_water_temperature_c`` and comes
back once the temperature has fallen to ``min_water_temperature_c``. The gap
between the two is a deadband — without it a boiler sitting at the limit would
switch on and off on every read cycle.

A cut outranks everything else:

  * the scheduler will not switch a cut boiler on
  * ``boiler.turn_on`` is refused while cut
  * the control menu refuses to toggle it on

Recovery hands control back to whoever had it: in automatic mode the schedule
re-asserts whatever it wants right now, in manual mode the boiler returns to the
state it was in before the cut.

Two probe topologies exist in the field, and they are judged differently.

**Two or more probes on the unit** — inlet and outlet, say. The gradient across
the boiler is measurable, so ``max_water_temperature_c`` is a *ceiling*: cut on
reaching it, restore at ``min_water_temperature_c``, or one fallback deadband
below the maximum when the server sends no minimum.

**One probe on the unit.** A single probe cannot tell flow from return, so it
reads as the boiler's own temperature and the configured value is the *target*
it is held at: cut one band above, restore the same band below.
``BOILERROOM_SINGLE_PROBE_BAND`` sets the band (3 °C). Note what this means —
such a boiler is allowed to run up to one band *above*
``max_water_temperature_c`` before it is cut.

The topology is read from the **mapping**, never from which probes happen to be
readable this cycle. Deciding it from live readings would let a failed outlet
probe quietly move a two-probe boiler onto the single-probe band — changing a
safety threshold because of a fault.

Sensor selection:
  cut     — the hottest of this unit's outlet, inlet and body probes, so a
            runaway on any of them trips
  restore — the *control* probe, in order of preference: outlet, then body,
            then inlet. Outlet is what the boiler is actually delivering and
            body is the next best proxy for it; inlet comes last because
            return water commonly sits above the restore point, and judging
            recovery on it would hold a boiler off indefinitely. A cut
            additionally will not clear while any probe is still at or above
            the cut-out, so a stuck-hot probe cannot cause on/off chatter.
  ambient — environment_inside only; outdoor temperature must not cut boilers

A boiler the mapping gives no probe at all, or that the config gives no maximum
for, has no over-temperature cut. That is said out loud at WARNING rather than
left silent — it is how boilers 1 and 2 of this installation ran unprotected:
their only probe was ``boiler_body``, which the cut did not look at.
