"""
Local schedule editing.

Schedules are published from the cloud, but an operator standing in the boiler
room has to be able to change the heating programme without it — the same
argument that put control modes on the device (menu option 7). A site whose
uplink is dead, or a room being commissioned before anything has been
published, still needs its programme in someone's hands.

Every edit is a mutation of the raw ``schedule.apply`` document and is handed
back to ``parse_schedule`` before it is accepted, so a locally built schedule
passes exactly the checks a server push does. There is deliberately no second,
weaker validator here to drift out of step with the real one.

An edit is **offered upstream**: ``schedule.update`` (DEVICE.md) hands the new
weekly rules to the server, which creates a schedule version for the room and
names it in ``schedule.update_ack``. The edit then stops being local at all —
it *is* the room's schedule, and the server pushes it to the room's other
devices.

Everything below is what happens until that succeeds, which matters because the
device is expected to run through outages:

  * the edit drives the relays immediately, published or not
  * it is held as an override on the last published version, and retried on
    the next connection
  * while unpublished the device keeps reporting the *published*
    ``schedule_version`` — bumping it would only make the server notice a
    mismatch on the next hello and push its own schedule back, wiping the
    change before it could be offered
  * a ``schedule.apply`` supersedes an unpublished edit and deletes the
    override: the room's owner published something, and that outranks a local
    edit that never made it up

An unpublished edit is a divergence the server cannot see, so everything that
can show it does — the control menu, the log at WARNING, and ``device.state``.
