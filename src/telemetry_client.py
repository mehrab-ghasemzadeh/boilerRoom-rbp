"""
Post sensor readings and device state to the server telemetry API.

The envelope follows the schema in DEVICE.md. Fields the device cannot
determine (no wifi interface, for example) are omitted rather than sent as
nulls.

Errors are deliberately *not* included in the envelope: they go to
POST /devices/<id>/errors, where each entry is documented to become an alert.
Repeating them here risks duplicate alerts, and an empty ``errors: []`` on a
device that has just reported a fault would be actively misleading.
