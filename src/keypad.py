"""
4x4 matrix keypad on the GPIO header.

This is the control menu's input device on the real hardware, in place of the
keyboard: an operator standing at the boiler has no terminal, and every menu
already asks for a number, so a keypad is enough to reach all of it. See
``keypad_layout`` for the pin map, the key table and the line editor.

Scanning runs on its own thread, not on the shared ``asyncio.to_thread``
executor. That pool has a handful of workers on a single-core Pi and the
control menu already parks one of them in ``input()`` forever; a second
permanent occupant would start starving the file writes and hardware reads that
pass through it. Keys reach the event loop by ``call_soon_threadsafe``.

Cost: idle, a poll drives nothing and reads four pins, 25 times a second — a
few hundred microseconds of CPU per second on a Pi Zero W. The full row-by-row
scan only runs while a key is actually down. Interrupts would be cheaper still,
but RPi.GPIO's edge detection has to be torn down and rebuilt around each scan
of the same pins, which is both slower and more fragile than the polling it
would replace.
